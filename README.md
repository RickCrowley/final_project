Allows you to view everything posted under the browse.js function and refresh if new things are added to the site.

Project overview:

    We created and developed Whiskey Exchange, project ID#10. The Whiskey Exchange is a online portal for users to keep track of their favorite spirits, and a way for users to discover new brands and experiences. Functionality and features include:
    1. New users create an acount
    2. Users will sign-in using the appropriate authorization 
    3. All site functionality will be hidden behind the sign-in
    3. Once signed in users can:
        a. Browse the Shelves - Users can scroll through options that have already been submitted to the site.  If they are in interested in the product, they can click the add to my bar button that submits that product to their profile.
        b. Add to Shelves -  When a user clicks add to the shelves, he/she can post a product that submits to the browse page database.  This allows other users to view the entry.
        c. View My Bar- When a user clicks his/her bar, he/she can see a list of brands they have previously added to their profile and a list of brands they have previously added to the bar via the interested button.  
        d. Sign Out
