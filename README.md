Project overview:

    For our project, we have decided to take on project ID#10 the whiskey exchange (name TBD). Our site will create a marketplace for users to trade various whiskies (or other spirits). The MVP functionality will include:
    1. Users will sign-in using the appropriate authorization solutions
    2. All site functionality will be hidden behind the sign-in
    3. Once signed in users can:
        a. List items they have for trade
        b. List items they are looking for
        c. Items would be posted using a form that would include inputs for a description, suggested value, and image URL (potentially spirit type/category)
        d. When posted, they'd be listed by the user's name obtained from the sign-in
        e. Tag items as "Interested" that other users have posted as available and create a separate list of their interested items
        f. Users can click "Interested" a second time to undo the previous actions
    4. Each user will have a unique view of their items listed, items available and items they are interested in

    Other potential features include:
    1. Clicking "Interested" changes the html styling around the images to differentiate them from unselected items
    2. Clicking "Interested" provides the email address of the poster and/or notifies the poster
    3. Users can filter by type of spirit
